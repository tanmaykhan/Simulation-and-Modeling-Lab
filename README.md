This repository is about some Simulation and Modeling Lab task practice.
In this repository, I have tried to solve 3 problem (Tasks) for simulation lab using python in Google Colab. These tasks are :-

1. Generate two vectors with 15 random floats each, plot them on the same graph, label the axes, and add a title.
2. Create a 4x4 matrix with random values, visualize it as a heatmap, and label the rows and columns.
3. Generate two 4x4 matrices, perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, visualize the results using bar plots, and discuss the effects.


N.B. :- I have provided a (.ipynb) file. In that ipynb file, You can find 3 separate code for the above 3 tasks.
