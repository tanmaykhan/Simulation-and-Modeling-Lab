This repository is about some Simulation and Modeling Lab task practice.
In this repository, I have tried to solve some problems (Tasks) for simulation lab using python in Google Colab. These tasks are :-

1. Generate two vectors with 15 random floats each, plot them on the same graph, label the axes, and add a title.
2. Create a 4x4 matrix with random values, visualize it as a heatmap, and label the rows and columns.
3. Generate two 4x4 matrices, perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, visualize the results using bar plots, and discuss the effects.
4. Use numpy to create a 3×3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50.  
   - With a fixed seed (`np.random.seed(10)`) to ensure reproducibility.  
   - Without setting a seed, allowing random values to change each time.  
   - Observe and explain the differences in outputs.  (in a different cell as text)
5. Data: [5.2, 5.4, 5.1, 5.6, 5.3, 5.8] <br> Hypothesized mean: 5.5
   <br>• Tasks :-
   - Calculate the t-statistic and p-value.
   - Interpret and visualize the result at a 0.05 significance level.
6. Generate two sets of from a normal distribution and perform a two-sample t-test.
   - Randomly generate 50 values from a normal distribution with a chosen mean (μ1) and standard deviation.
   - Randomly generate 50 values from a normal distribution with a different mean (μ2) and standard deviation.
 
 Use and determine whether the means differ significantly.


N.B. :- I have provided these (.ipynb) files. In those ipynb files, You can find the codes.
