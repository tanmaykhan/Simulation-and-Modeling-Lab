### Lab Assignment - 02 <br> ID : 2215151024

This repository is about some Simulation and Modeling Lab task practice. In this repository, I have tried to solve some problem (Tasks) for simulation lab using python in Google Colab. These tasks are :-

--Use numpy to create a 3Ã—3 matrix of random integers between 1 and 50.  
  1. Run the code twice
  2. With a fixed seed (`np.random.seed(10)`) to ensure reproducibility.  
  3. Without setting a seed, allowing random values to change each time.
Then
  Observe and explain the differences in outputs. (in a different cell as text)

N.B. :- I have provided a (.ipynb) file. In that ipynb file, You can find 3 separate code for the above 3 tasks.
